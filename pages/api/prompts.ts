    graph_prompt: `Based on the following detailed system design, create a visual graph structure that represents the key components and their relationships.

Product Context: {product_intent}

DETAILED SYSTEM DESIGN:
{detailed_design}

ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: STRUCTURED SECTIONS WITH CLEAR TITLES AND ORGANIZATION** ðŸš¨

Create a well-organized graph with DISTINCT SECTIONS, each with clear section titles and enhanced spacing for maximum readability:

**MANDATORY SECTION ORGANIZATION:**
1. **DYNAMIC SECTION TITLES** - Create relevant sections based on the business use case (examples: FRONTEND, BACKEND, DATABASE, AI/ML, INFRASTRUCTURE, AUTHENTICATION, PAYMENTS, ANALYTICS, COMMUNICATION, etc.) - DO NOT use static hard-coded sections, adapt to the specific business context
2. **Main Technology Nodes** - Core components under each section with specific API/SDK implementations
3. **Sub-explanation Nodes** - Connected nodes that explain what each technology is and include user psychology insights
4. **Feature Nodes** - Specific features with behavioral reasoning and psychological drivers
5. **Visual Separation** - Clear spacing between sections with descriptive section headers
6. **Color Grouping** - Related nodes should have the same color category within sections
7. **EDGE LABELS** - All meaningful connections MUST have descriptive labels explaining the flow, relationship, or data exchange
8. **CONTEXTUAL EDGE TYPES** - Use different edge types based on the relationship context (step for sequential flows, sine for complex data transformations, smoothstep for user interactions, straight for direct API calls)

**NODE STRUCTURE RULES:**
- **Keep nodes concise** - Maximum 2-3 sentences per node
- **Split complex explanations** - If a technology needs more explanation, create connected sub-nodes
- **Use intuitive explanations** - Explain what each technology actually is
- **Include behavioral reasoning** - Explain WHY each feature matters for user behavior
- **Color-code by section**:
  - Section Headers: Dark (#1F2328) - Bold titles for each section
  - Frontend: Blue (#3B82F6) with lighter variants (#60A5FA, #93C5FD)
  - Backend: Green (#10B981) with lighter variants (#34D399, #6EE7B7)
  - Database: Purple (#8B5CF6) with lighter variants (#A78BFA, #C4B5FD)
  - AI/ML: Orange (#F59E0B) with lighter variants (#FBBF24, #FCD34D)
  - Infrastructure: Gray (#6B7280) with lighter variants (#9CA3AF, #D1D5DB)

**MANDATORY NODE FORMAT:**
Section Header: "SECTION NAME" (e.g., "FRONTEND", "BACKEND", "DATABASE") - Large, bold section titles
Main Node: "Technology Name - Brief description of what it is and its primary purpose"
Sub Node: "What is [Technology]? - Simple explanation of what this technology actually does"
Feature Node: "Feature Name - What it does and WHY it's needed for user behavior"

**EXAMPLES OF GOOD NODE STRUCTURE:**

Section Header: "FRONTEND" - Section title for all frontend technologies and components
Main Node: "React Frontend - JavaScript library for building user interfaces with reusable components"
Sub Node: "What is React? - A tool that helps developers create interactive websites by breaking them into small, reusable pieces called components"
Feature Node: "User Dashboard - Provides personalized view because users need quick access to their most important data"

**ENHANCED POSITIONING STRATEGY WITH OPTIMAL SPACING:**
- **Section Headers**: Top of each section (y: 20) with section titles
  - Frontend Header: x: 300, y: 20
  - Backend Header: x: 900, y: 20  
  - Database Header: x: 1500, y: 20
  - AI/ML Header: x: 2100, y: 20 (if applicable)
- **Frontend Section**: Left area (x: 50-550) - 500px wide zone
- **Backend Section**: Center-left area (x: 650-1150) - 500px wide zone  
- **Database Section**: Center-right area (x: 1250-1750) - 500px wide zone
- **AI/ML Section**: Right area (x: 1850-2350, if applicable) - 500px wide zone
- **Infrastructure**: Bottom spanning sections (y: 900+)
- **Vertical Spacing Within Sections**: 
  - Section headers: y: 20
  - Main nodes: y: 100, 450, 800 (350px spacing for breathing room)
  - Sub-explanation nodes: y: 250, 600, 950 (150px below main nodes)
  - Feature nodes: y: 175, 525, 875 (staggered for visual separation)

**ENHANCED SPACING REQUIREMENTS - PREVENT ALL OVERLAPS:**
- Section headers clearly separated at top of each section (y: 20)
- **MINIMUM 500px horizontal spacing between different sections** (increased from 200px)
- **MINIMUM 300px horizontal spacing between nodes within the same section** (increased from 150px)
- **MINIMUM 300px vertical spacing between main node rows within sections** (increased from 200px)
- Sub-nodes positioned **150px below their parent nodes** (increased from 100px)
- Feature nodes positioned with **100px horizontal offset** to avoid overlap (increased from 50px)
- **600px spacing between major sections** (Frontend, Backend, Database, AI/ML) - increased from 400px
- Infrastructure nodes span bottom with **100px margin** from section edges
- **NODE SIZE CONSIDERATION**: Assume each node is approximately 200px wide x 100px tall for spacing calculations
- **STAGGER POSITIONING**: Within sections, alternate node y-positions to create visual breathing room
- **COLLISION DETECTION**: Ensure no node positions overlap by checking coordinates before placement

**ENHANCED EDGE REQUIREMENTS:**
- **EDGE LABELS**: Every meaningful connection MUST include a descriptive label explaining the flow, relationship, or data exchange (e.g., "User Authentication Flow", "API Request", "Data Sync", "Payment Processing")
- **CONTEXTUAL EDGE TYPES**:
  - "step": For sequential processes and workflows (user onboarding, checkout flow)
  - "sine": For complex data transformations and algorithms (ML processing, data analysis)
  - "smoothstep": For user interactions and real-time features (live chat, notifications)
  - "straight": For direct API calls and simple data transfers
  - "default": For basic explanatory connections between nodes and their descriptions
- **DIRECTIONAL FLOW**: Show clear data flow between components with proper directional arrows
- **SECTION SEPARATORS**: Use labeled edges to connect section headers to their main components
- **PSYCHOLOGICAL FLOWS**: Label edges that represent user behavior patterns or psychological triggers

**BEHAVIORAL REASONING REQUIREMENTS:**
For each feature node, include:
- WHAT the feature does
- WHY it's needed based on user behavior patterns
- HOW it addresses the original core problem
- WHAT user actions it enables or improves

ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL JSON OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS** ðŸš¨
