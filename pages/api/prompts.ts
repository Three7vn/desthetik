DETAILED SYSTEM DESIGN:
{detailed_design}

ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: STRUCTURED NODE ORGANIZATION WITH OPTIMAL SPACING** ðŸš¨

Create a well-organized graph with the following structure and enhanced spacing for maximum readability:

**NODE ORGANIZATION REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **Main Technology Nodes** - Core components (React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, etc.)
2. **Sub-explanation Nodes** - Connected nodes that explain what each technology is
3. **Feature Nodes** - Specific features or capabilities with behavioral reasoning
4. **Color Grouping** - Related nodes should have the same color category
5. **Proper Spacing** - Ensure adequate spacing between all components for easy reading

**NODE STRUCTURE RULES:**
- **Keep nodes concise** - Maximum 2-3 sentences per node
- **Split complex explanations** - If a technology needs more explanation, create connected sub-nodes
- **Use intuitive explanations** - Explain what each technology actually is
- **Include behavioral reasoning** - Explain WHY each feature matters for user behavior
- **Color-code by category**:
  - Frontend: Blue (#3B82F6)
  - Backend: Green (#10B981) 
  - Database: Purple (#8B5CF6)
  - Services: Orange (#F59E0B)
